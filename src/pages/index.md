  <p>80 billion mobile messages are sent each day via carriers and ISPs. Mobile
  mesh networks offer an anti-fragile, decentralized alternative that can extend

    This whitepaper describes our open-source plan for including incentive
    payments along with data to encourage successful delivery by nodes in the
    network. Users pay each other, instead of a centralized ISP or mobile
    carrier, for providing essential communication services. Lot49 builds on
    technology developed for the Bitcoin Lightning Network to drive mesh network
    adoption by incentivizing coverage and capacity where and when it is needed.
