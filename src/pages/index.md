title: A mesh-based P2P | messaging network  
heading: A mesh-based P2P messaging network  
subheading: <p>80 billion mobile messages are sent each day via carriers and ISPs. Mobile mesh networks offer an anti-fragile, decentralized alternative that can extend connectivity to places centralized networks can’t. </p><p>The first step to building out a peer-to-peer global messaging network is to optimize for successful message delivery.</p>

  title: The Lot49 protocol
  text: >
    The Lot49 protocol whitepaper describes our open-source plan for including incentive payments along with data to encourage successful delivery by nodes in the network. In this way the protocol lets users pay each other, instead of a centralized ISP or mobile carrier, for providing essential communication services. The Lot49 protocol builds on technology developed for the Bitcoin Lightning Network to improve mesh network data delivery and drive bottom-up adoption by incentivizing people to provide coverage and capacity where and when it is needed.
