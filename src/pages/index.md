  title: Lot49
  text: >
    The Lot49 protocol builds on concepts and technology developed for the 
    Bitcoin Lightning Network to incentivize data delivery in a mobile mesh
    communication network. Lot49 aims to make it possible to use bitcoin
    based micropayments to solve the following problems faced by existing mesh networks
