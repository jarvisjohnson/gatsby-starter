      Daniela is the co-founder &amp; CEO of <a rel="nopened noreferer" target="_blank" href="https://gotenna.com/pages/about">goTenna</a>, and incubated the idea (<a rel="nopened noreferer" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWl2HBNyK48">watch her 2017 talk here</a>) for what eventually became Lot49 through her work building the world's first consumer-ready mobile mesh networking system, <a rel="nopened noreferer" target="_blank" href="https://gotennamesh.com/">goTenna Mesh</a>. Inspired by the <a rel="nopened noreferer" target="_blank" href="https://imeshyou.gotennamesh.com/">#imeshyou</a> community, she hopes the open-source Lot49 protocol will drive the build-out of an infrastructure-free global-scale decentralized mesh network, free of carriers and ISPs.
